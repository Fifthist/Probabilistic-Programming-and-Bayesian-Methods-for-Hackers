# [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
#### *Using Julia and Gen*


This fork is an effort to port Bayesian Methods for Hackers to Julia for pedagogy. **Credit for the material presented in the book belongs to the authors and contributors listed in the README of the source repository.** PyMC and TFP files from the source repository are used as reference for the port. The book has a very rich ecosystem of recorded lectures and supplementary materials around it, so I recommend checking out the source repository for more information.

Inference is done using [Gen](https://probcomp.github.io/Gen/). As much as a tool to learn how to apply probabilistic programming, this fork is an attempt to better understand Gen.


## Why Gen

Gen exposes flexible mechanisms for implementing custom inference algorithms. It is also a system that is relatively early in its development making it easier for students to understand the codebase  and contribute to it.
